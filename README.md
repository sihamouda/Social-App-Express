# Social App

In this repository, you will find my personal web project: It's a simple social media app made of React, React-Bootstrap as a Front-End and Express.JS as Back-end.

This project is made for learning purpose. I wanted to improve my skills in JavaScript and especially understand how Frond-End and Back-End communicates in Real-Life.

## Progress

### Day 1 - 3:

In these days, I learned more about Express.JS where I discovered Routing, Middlewares and Templating.
When I discovered Pug, I decided to a more Real-Life project so that I can encounter more Real-Life scenarios.

Therefore, I started a React Front-End: I'm using React-Bootstrap so I can gain time and focus more on the Front-Back communication.

I fixed a Navbar in the App component, integrated React-Router v6 so we can route from component to another (For now, we have Home , About , SignIn, LogIn Components).

Finally I made a RESTful API to get the submitted data from the SignIn component.

## Nextstep

I'm going to make another API to the LogIn component, make the Back-End code cleaner, and work on implementing a socket between the Front and the Back to get notifications on registration/login
